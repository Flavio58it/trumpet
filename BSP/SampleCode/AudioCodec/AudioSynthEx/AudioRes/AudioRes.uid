; UID file provides user to define play equation, and speech that will be used in program


[Equation]
; ===================================================================
; The equation links some speech one by one.For each speech, there are
; some parameters affecting,playback like volume, speech's sample rate,
; and number of times to repeat.
; Syntax
; 	DEFEQU equation_name <ext= 0, equ="Play equation content">
;
; Description
;	equation_name: A given equation name which will be played in program.
;	ext: Reserved for future use, set it to 0 now.
;	equ: "Play equation content".
;		 "equation content"--->
;		 	play sentence A + play sentence B + ...
;		 	where "+":Link the play sentences in series.
;		 "Play sentence"--->
;		 	1.N_times * file_name
;		 	where "N_times": number of times to repeat. 0 means endless.
;			2.<sr=sample rate>
;			where "sr": change original sample rate for desired audio.

[Audio]
; ===================================================================
; All speech files and files in play equation, should be defined here
; Syntax
; 	DEFAUD file_name < ext= 0, format= XXX , bitrate=Y.Y>
;
; Description
;	file_name: The speech file name (without extention name) which will be played in program.
;	ext: Reserved for future use, set it to 0 now.
;	format: audio format will be stored in storage
;		"MD4", "P16", "LP8", "NUS", "NUO", "NUL", "NUV" for speech
;		"MID" is for Midi.
;	bitrate: encoded bits for one sample
;		Range of NUS: 1.5~3.0 bits
;		Range of NUO: 0.8~2.0 bits
;		Range of NUL: 0.5~3.0 bits
;		Range of NUV: 0.3, 0.7, and 0.8
